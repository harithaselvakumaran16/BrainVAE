# rsfMRI-VAE
This repository is the official Pytorch implementation of '[Representation Learning of Resting State fMRI with Variational Autoencoder](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118423)'

## Environments

This code is developed and tested with 

```
Python 2.7.17
Pytorch 1.2.0
```

## Training

To train the model in this paper, run this command:

```train
python fMRIVAE_Train.py --data-path path-to-your-data
```

## Evaluation

If you want to get latent variables of the trained model, change path inside the code `Example_Encoder.py` and run:

```eval1
python Example_Encoder.py
```

If you want to reconstruct images from the latent variables, change path inside the code `Example_Decoder.py` and run:

```eval2
python Example_Decoder.py
```


## Demo
Directory `demo` includes a whole pipeline from processing fMRI data to getting latent variables from VAE. A brief illustration of the pipeline is shown in the figure below.

The file in the data folder is a cifti file that can be inputted into the `preprocess.m` function, which outputs a cifti file with preprocessed data.  Either the original or preprocessed file can be inputted into the `geometric_reformatting.m` file which outputs a mat file called fMRI.mat and an h5 file called `demo_data.h5` into the data folder.  

The data loader in `/demo/lib/utils.py` feeds the reformatted 
data into the VAE when `VAE_inference.py` is run.  This function uses the pretrained model to generate latent variables which are saved in `/demo/result/demolatent` as mat files.  

`VAE_inference.py` also uses the latent variables to generate reconstructed images in `/demo/result/recon` as mat files.  Then `backward_reformatting.m` converts the data back into a cifti file called: `/demo/data/rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_MSMAll_hp2000_clean_reconstruction.dtseries.nii`.

### Usage

Steps for running the VAE data preparation code:

0. Clone github repository into your local computer. 
    - `git clone https://github.com/libilab/rsfMRI-VAE.git`
1. Sample inputs data and trained model weights must be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EZug6qm27pk-pfVwx4knqC4oERLI6LZ6?usp=sharing). Place downloaded files into the same directory in `demo`.

    - Download `/checkpoint/checkpoint.pth.tar` into `/demo/checkpoint/`.
    - Download `/data/rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_MSMAll_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii` into `/demo/data/`.

2. run `preprocess.m`

3. run `geometric_reformatting.m`
4. run `VAE_inference.py`
5. run `backward_reformatting.m`

### Output Layouts
The following intermediate `mat` files will be saved while running the demo codes:

- `demo/data/fMRI.mat`
    - matrix that holds normalized fMRI data for each time point 
    - size: `(num voxels in visual cortex) x (number time points)`
    - This file includes only voxels in valid regions (gets rid of any nan values).

- `/result/MSE_Mask.mat` 
    - This file includes two fields: `Regular_Grid_Right_Mask` and `Regular_Grid_Left_Mask`. 
    - Those two fields hold `im_size x im_size` 2D masks telling whether that voxel is valid, or has an `nan` value (meaning that the data points must be excluded).

- `/result/Left_fMRI2Grid_192_by_192_NN.mat`
    - This file includes two fields: `grid_mapping_L`, `inverse_transformation_L`
- `/result/Right_fMRI2Grid_192_by_192_NN.mat`
    - This file includes two fields: `grid_mapping_R`, `inverse_transformation_R`
    - The grid mapping (for each of L/R) is size `(im_size x im_size) x num_voxels` (without `nan`) and will be multiplied by the voxel data for each time point to map them to the 2D grid the inverse transformation (for each of L/R) maps the data in the 2D grid back to the  voxel space
